Note, this is not commented yet!

BOOST, Compiler Quirks, and STL are placeholders currently. STL is implemented in exercises all over regardless. Compiler quirks in the event I need to figure something out.

Exceptions and pointers are were I was getting comfortable again. Not every exercise is as featured given some were used as combination exercises. Note my use of dereferencing a function pointer and using a function pointer properly. This was to demonstrate why it was valid.
