Note, this is not commented yet!

BOOST, Compiler Quirks, and STL are placeholders currently. STL is implemented in exercises all over regardless. Compiler quirks in the event I need to figure something out.

Exceptions and pointers are were I was getting comfortable again. Not every exercise is as featured given some were used as combination exercises. Note my varying ways of obtaining a function pointer. This was to demonstrate the different valid means to do so, but some are less appropriate than others.
